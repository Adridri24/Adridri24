## Welcome to my Github profile ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Adrien Jayat** and I am a student in the last year of High School, specializing in Maths, Physics and Computer Science.

I learned programming on my own, I like its logical and creative aspect.
I think computer science is a universal, very rich and very vast field; and will undoubtedly be at the heart of the decades to come.

## My Skills

### Python 3
[![Python 3](https://img.icons8.com/color/75/000000/python.png)](https://python.org)
I started coding in Python since college, it's a language that I really appreciate: you can use it for almost any project!
I use it for scientific use, to build website's backends and APIs, softwares and algorithms.

**~~Python is slow?~~** But do we need speed on all projects? <br>
**~~Python is for beginners?~~** Do you know advanced features like generators, metaclasses, descriptors, coroutines?
It's a language that targets both beginners and confirmed developers by its simple and concise syntax for a great coding efficiency!

### Libraries and frameworks:

#### Projects
- [PyBoss](https://github.com/Adridri24/PyBoss) (A Discord Bot built for my class during the lockdown in 2020.
  Provide features like quiz, agenda & planning, role automation...)
- [Django Quickstart](https://github.com/Adridri24/DjangoOfficialTuto)

### Javascript

[![React](img/React.png)](https://fr.reactjs.org/)

I started coding in Javascript a year ago, it's a must-have for web developpement to build dynamics websites.

#### Projects
 - [Math En Jeans](https://github.com/Adridri24/MEJ) (A website for the math club in Albert Claveille High School, built with
   [Alexis B.](https://github.com/Alexis-ba6))
   
### C++
[![C++](https://img.icons8.com/color/80/000000/c-plus-plus-logo.png)](https://www.cplusplus.com/)
I have learn C++ for severals months, I needed a compiled and powerful language, especially for video games. <br>
I like static typing and C++ offers many advantages but requires more coding time and it's less portable as Python.

## Other tools & languages
