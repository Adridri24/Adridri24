## Welcome to my Github profile ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Adrien Jayat** and I am a student in the last year of High School, specializing in Maths, Physics and Computer Science.

I learned programming on my own, I like its logical and creative aspect.
I think computer science is a universal, very rich and very vast field; and will undoubtedly be at the heart of the decades to come.

## My Skills

### Python 3
[![Python 3](https://img.icons8.com/color/75/000000/python.png)](https://python.org)
I have been coding in Python since I was 13 years old, it's a language that I really appreciate: you can use it for almost any project!
I use it for scientific use, to build website backends and APIs, softwares and algorithms.

*Python is slow?* But do we need speed on all projects? <br>
*Python is for beginners?* Do you know advanced features like generators, metaclasses, descriptors, coroutines?
It's a language that targets both beginners and confirmed developers by its simple and concise syntax for great coding efficiency!

### Libraries and frameworks:

[![Matplotlib](img/Matplotlib.png)](https://matplotlib.org/)
[![Django](img/Django.png)](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
[![Flask](img/Flask.png)](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
[![Pygame](img/Pygame.png)](https://www.pygame.org/)
[![Tensorflow](img/Tensorflow.png)](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
[![Pandas](img/Pandas.png)](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

#### Projects
- [PyBoss](https://github.com/Adridri24/PyBoss) (A Discord Bot built for my class during lockdown in 2020.
  Provide features like quiz, agenda & planning, role automation...)
- [Django Quickstart](https://github.com/Adridri24/DjangoOfficialTuto)

### Javascript

[![React](img/React.png)](https://fr.reactjs.org/)

I started coding in Javascript a year ago, it's a must-have for web development to build dynamic websites.

#### Projects
 - [Math En Jeans](https://github.com/Adridri24/MEJ) (A website for the math club at Albert Claveille high school, built with
   [Alexis B.](https://github.com/Alexis-ba6))
   
### C++
[![C++](https://img.icons8.com/color/70/000000/c-plus-plus-logo.png)](https://www.cplusplus.com/)
I have been learning C++ for the past severals months, I needed a compiled and powerful language, especially for video games. I like static typing and C++ offers many advantages but requires more coding time and it's less portable as Python.

### Other tools & languages
[![Git](https://img.icons8.com/color/90/000000/git.png)](https://git-scm.com/)
[![PostgreSQL](img/PostgreSQL.png)](https://www.postgresql.org/)
