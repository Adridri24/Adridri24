## About Me
I am a computer science student at Telecom Physique Strasbourg. <br>
I learned programming by myself and I am passionate about algorithms.

### Python
I have been coding in [Python] since I was 13 years old.
Personally, I value it for scientific uses, to build website backends, APIs, algorithms and more recently, smart contracts on Ethereum.

#### Some projects
- [mp2i-discord-bot](https://github.com/prepas-mp2i/mp2i-discord-bot) a bot built for a Discord server of students.
- [robocup](https://github.com/ajayat/robocup) a project for the robotics club at my high school.

### C/C++
I have a very good command of C and [C++]. I use C for system programming mainly, and C++ to make projects such as games.

#### Some projects
- [tree-generator](https://github.com/ajayat/tree-generator) a C++ program to pretty print a tree in a terminal.
- [minichess](https://github.com/ajayat/minichess) a terminal-based chess game using the Stockfish engine.

### OCaml & Julia
[Julia] is a very promising language which combines the beauty and syntactic simplicity of Python with the speed of C++. 
I have also good basis in [OCaml].
