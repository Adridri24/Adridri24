## Welcome to my Github profile ðŸ‘‹
My name is Adrien Jayat and I am a student in the last year of High School, specialising in Maths, Physics and Computer Science.

I learned programming by myself, Iâ€™m fascinated by its logical and creative aspect. I think computer science is a universal, 
extraordinarily rich and vast field and will undoubtedly be at the heart of the decades to come.

## My Skills

### Python 3
[![Python 3](https://img.icons8.com/color/75/000000/python.png)](https://python.org)
I have been coding in Python since I was 14 years old; it's a language that I really appreciate as you can use it for almost any project. 
Personally, I value it for scientific uses, to build website backends, APIs, software and algorithms.
 
*Python is slow!* But is speed always the most essential thing? <br/>
*Python is for beginners!*  Not necessarily: do you know the advanced features such as generators, metaclasses, descriptors, coroutines? 
Python is a language that targets both beginners and confirmed developers with its simple and concise syntax for great coding efficiency!

### Libraries and frameworks:

#### Projects
- [PyBoss](https://github.com/Adridri24/PyBoss) 
(A Discord Bot built for my class during lockdown in 2020. Provide features like quizzes, notebook & calendar, role automation...)
- [Django Quickstart](https://github.com/Adridri24/DjangoOfficialTuto)

### Javascript

[![React](img/React.png)][React]

I started coding in Javascript a year ago, it's a must-have for web development to build dynamic websites.

#### Projects
 - [Math En Jeans](https://github.com/Adridri24/MEJ) (A website for the math club at my high school, Albert Claveille,, built with
   [Alexis B.](https://github.com/Alexis-ba6))

### C++
[![C++](https://img.icons8.com/color/70/000000/c-plus-plus-logo.png)][C++]
I have been learning C++ for the past several months as I needed a compiled and powerful language, especially for video games. 
I like static typing and C++ offers many advantages but it requires more coding time and it's less portable than Python.

### Other tools & languages
