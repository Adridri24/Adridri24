## About Me
I am a computer science student at a engineering school in France. <br>
I learned programming by myself and I am passionate about algorithms.

### Python 3
I have been coding in [Python] since I was 13 years old; it's a language that I really appreciate as you can use it for almost any project. 
Personally, I value it for scientific uses, to build website backends, APIs, algorithms and more recently, smart contracts on Ethereum.

- [mp2i-discord-bot](https://github.com/prepas-mp2i/mp2i-discord-bot) 
  (A bot built for a Discord server of students. Provide features like music, role automation, moderation and custom commands...)
- [robocup](https://github.com/ajayat/robocup) (A project for the robotics club at my high school).

### Javascript
I started coding in [Javascript] three years ago, it's a must-have for web development.

 - [mej-claveille](https://github.com/ajayat/mej-claveille) (A website for the math club at my high school, built with
   [Alexis B.](https://github.com/alexba6))

### C/C++
I have a strong knownledge of C and [C++]. I use C for system programming mainly, and C++ to make projects such as games.
- [tree-generator](https://github.com/ajayat/tree-generator) 
  (A C++ program to show a tree in the output console).

### OCaml & Julia
[Julia] is the little new one that I really like, it's a very promising language which combines the beauty and syntactic simplicity of Python with the speed of C++. 
I have also good basis in [OCaml].
