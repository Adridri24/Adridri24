## Welcome to my Github profile ðŸ‘‹
I am a student in the last year of High School, specialising in Maths, Physics and Computer Science. <br>
I learned programming by myself, Iâ€™m fascinated by its logical and creative aspect.

## My Skills

### Python 3
[![Python 3](https://img.icons8.com/color/75/000000/python.png)](https://python.org)
I have been coding in Python since I was 13 years old; it's a language that I really appreciate as you can use it for almost any project. 
Personally, I value it for scientific uses, to build website backends, APIs, software and algorithms.

### Libraries and frameworks:

[![Matplotlib](img/Matplotlib.png)][Matplotlib]
[![Django](img/Django.png)][Django]
[![Flask](img/Flask.png)][Flask]
[![Pygame](img/Pygame.png)][Pygame]
[![Tensorflow](img/Tensorflow.png)][Tensorflow]
[![Pandas](img/Pandas.png)][Pandas]

#### Projects
- [PyBoss](https://github.com/Adridri24/PyBoss) 
(A Discord Bot built for my class during lockdown in 2020. Provide features like quizzes, notebook & calendar, role automation...)
- [Django Quickstart](https://github.com/Adridri24/DjangoOfficialTuto)

### Javascript

[![React](img/React.png)][React]

I started coding in Javascript two years ago, it's a must-have for web development to build dynamic websites.

#### Projects
 - [Math En Jeans](https://github.com/Adridri24/MEJ) (A website for the math club at my high school, Albert Claveille,, built with
   [Alexis B.](https://github.com/Alexis-ba6))

### C++
[![C++](https://img.icons8.com/color/70/000000/c-plus-plus-logo.png)][C++]
I have been learning C++ for the past last year as I needed a compiled and powerful language, especially for video games (Unreal Engine). 

### Ocaml
[![OCaml](img/OCaml.png)][OCaml]
I need OCaml for my next studies, It's a very powerful language for functional programming.

### Julia
[![Julia](img/Julia.png)][Julia]
The little new one that I really like, Julia is a very promising language which combines the beauty and syntactic simplicity of python with the speed of C++. This makes it the ideal language for data science and math!

### Other tools & languages
[![Git](https://img.icons8.com/color/90/000000/git.png)][Git]
[![PostgreSQL](img/PostgreSQL.png)][PostgreSQL]
[![MySQL](img/MySQL.png)][MySQL]
