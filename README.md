## Welcome to my Github profile ðŸ‘‹
I am a student in a scientific preparatory class for engineering schools in France. I am passionate about math and computer science. <br>
I learned programming by myself, Iâ€™m fascinated by its logical and creative aspect.

### Python 3
I have been coding in [Python] since I was 13 years old; it's a language that I really appreciate as you can use it for almost any project. 
Personally, I value it for scientific uses, to build website backends, APIs, software and algorithms.

#### Libraries and frameworks:

- [pyboss](https://github.com/ajayat/pyboss) 
  (A Discord Bot built for my class during lockdown in 2020. Provide features like quizzes, notebook & calendar, role automation...)
- [robocup](https://github.com/ajayat/robocup) (A project for the robotics club at my high school).
- [exercism.io](https://github.com/ajayat/exercism.io)
  (My solutions to the language tracks on [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io/) tracks in C++, Python and OCaml).

### Javascript
I started coding in [Javascript] two years ago, it's a must-have for web development to build dynamic websites.

 - [mej-claveille](https://github.com/ajayat/mej-claveille) (A website for the math club at my high school, built with
   [Alexis B.](https://github.com/alexba6))

### C++
I have been learning [C++] for the past last year as I needed a compiled and powerful language, especially for video games (Unreal Engine).
- [tree-generator](https://github.com/ajayat/tree-generator) 
  (A C++ program to show a  tree in the output console).

### Ocaml & Julia
[OCaml] a very powerful language for functional programming. <br>
[Julia] is the little new one that I really like, it's a very promising language which combines the beauty and syntactic simplicity of python with the speed of C++. This makes it the ideal language for data science and math!
